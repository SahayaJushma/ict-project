        <h4><b>What is Internet?</b></h4>
       
        <p>The Internet is the global (world wide) system of interconnected
             computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suit (TCP/IP) to communicate with one
              another or communicate between networks and devices.</p>

        <ul>
            <li> <b>Client –</b> We are use Mobile, Laptop, Desktop, etc.</li>
            <li> <b>Client Document – </b>Client working area display document.</li>
            <li> www.google.com – Fully Qualified Name/Domain Name/Url.</li>
            <li> Google – Search Engine.</li>
            <li>HTML Document – Send and Receive.</li>
            <li> UDP – User Datagram Protocol.</li>
            <li> TCP – Transmission Control Protocol.</li>
            <li> IP – Internet Protocol.</li>
            <li> DNS – Domain Name System</li>
            <li> ARP – Address Resolution Protocol.</li>
            <li> RARP – Reverse Address Resolution Protocol.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><b><u>Internet Working Principle:</u></b></h4>
        <p>Client request type the url (www.google.com) name (i.e., HTML document) in a
            browser, that transfer a UDP protocol to search details from a DNS which act as a server. 
            The server provides a IP address (i.e., number sequence at 102.102.21.21) that given to the 
            browser. At a few second of time, the browser got the IP address given to a TCP/IP protocol 
            that use split packages then transfer to an ARP/RARP protocol which act as a web server. 
            The ARP arranges the orders of sequence packages number identified that provides the client 
            need response to the HTML document. Some time, if web server send response not correct to 
            the client request, and retransmit on the data that uses the RARP protocol. Finally, client gets 
            the display screen (i.e., mobile, laptop or desktop, etc.) document (HTML document).</p>
          <h4><b><u>Definitions:</u></b></h4>    
          <p><b><u>Client:</u></b> Used in home and corporate networks, a client is <b>any computer hardware or 
            software device that requests access to a service provided by a server.</b></p>
            <p><b><u>WWW:</u></b> It is collection of machines particularly webservers (i.e., Web Engine) which provide 
                HTML document.</p>
                <p><b><u>Server –</u></b> It is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer 
                    program and its user, also known as the client.</p>
                    <p><b><u>Web Server –</u></b> It is a computer that stores web server software and a website's component 
                        files (for example, HTML documents, images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files).</p>
                <p><b><u>DNS -</u></b> This is a domain name system or service in which internet service translates the 
                    domain name into IP addresses because these are alphabetic and easy to remember.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Every time when we use a domain name, a DNS service must translate the name into the 
                corresponding IP addresses.</li>
                <br>
                <li>However, IP address is really based on the internet, or we can say the internet is really 
                    based on IP addresses.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4><u>Generic Domain:</u></h4>
        <p>This is also known as the organization domain which divides registered hosts as 
            per the generic behaviour.</p>
            <h3><u>Named host:</u></h3>
            <ol>
                <li>.com : Commercial organization,</li>
                <li>.edu: Educational institution,</li>
                <li>.gov: Government Institutions,</li>
                <li>.In : International Organization,</li>
                <li>.mil : Military group,</li>
                <li>.net: Network Provider,</li>
                <li>.org: Organization – (low amount domain),</li>
                <li>.in: Indian Organization.</li>
            </ol>

        <h4><u>HTTP</u> – Hyper Text Transfer Protocol</h4>
        <p>It is the request (client) response (server) communication Model.</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Request – Client</li>
            <li>Response – Server</li>
            <li> Document – HTML</li>

        <h4>What is IP?</h4>
        <p>Internet Protocol Suit representing the address of each machine in a doted decimal 
            format is known as Internet Protocol.</p>
        <p>Eg: 102.102.21.21, 192.164.0.1</p>
        <h4>Computer or Mobile includes two address:</h4>
        <p>Therefore,</p>
        <ol>
            <li>MAC Address – Physical Address (i.e., Manufacturing company)- E.g: Person Name</li>
            <li>IP Address – Logic Address (i.e., unique)- E.g: Home Address</li>
        </ol>
        <h4><b><u>IMEI Number:</u></b> International Mobile Equipment Identity</h4>
        <p>IMEI is a 15-17-digit code that is given to every mobile phone. This number is used 
            by service providers to uniquely identify valid devices.</p>
          <h4><b><u>ARP:</u></b> Address Resolution Protocol</h4>  
          <p>Mapping from logic address to physical address protocol is called ARP.</p>
          <h4><b><u>RARP:</u></b>> Reverse Address Resolution Protocol</h4>
          <p>Mapping from physical address to logic address protocol is called RARP.</p>
          <h4>What is Webpage?</h4>
          <p> It is an electronic document. It is a HTML document or HTML page.</p>
      <h4>What is website?</h4>
      <p>It is a collection of web pages.</p>
      <h4><u>Hypertext:</u></h4>
      <p> It is a navigation link to one page to another page.</p>
      <h4><u>Front End:</u></h4>
      <p>It is a presentation layer, which is create a using HTML, React and Angular.</p>
      <h4><u>Back End:</u></h4>
      <p>It is a data layer from which data is fetched and displayed in front end.</p>
<p>Common back end data bases are,</p>
<ul>
    <li> MySQL database</li>
    <li> Post SQL</li>
    <li> SQL server</li>
    <li> Oracle</li>
    <li> Mongodb</li>
    <li> ClickHouse</li>
</ul>
<p>Database divided into two types,</p>
<ol>
    <li>Relational database (i.e., Structural database) - Table, row, column – (20% data store)</li>
    <li>Non-relational database (i.e. Unstructural database) -No SQL-No table, row, column –
        (80% data store)</li>
</ol>
<h4><b><u>ADF –</u></b> Azure Data Factory</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Data bricks</li>
    <p>Azure Data Factory is a cloud-based data integration service that allows you to create data-driven workflows in the cloud for orchestrating and automating data movement and data
