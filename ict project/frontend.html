        <ul>
            <li><b>M</b>odel <b>V</b>iew <b>C</b>ontroller or <b>MVC</b> as it is popularly called, is a software
                design pattern for developing web applications. A Model View
                Controller pattern is made up of the following three parts −</li>
                <li><b>Model </b>− The lowest level of the pattern which is responsible for
                    maintaining data.</li>
                    <li><b>View </b>− This is responsible for displaying all or a portion of the data to
                        the user.</li>
                        <li><b>Controller</b> − Software Code that controls the interactions between
                            the Model and View.</li>
               </ul>

               <h3>MVC Explain</h3>
               <h4>The Model</h4>
               <ul>
                <li>The model is responsible for managing the data of the application. It
                    responds to the request from the view and it also responds to
                    instructions from the controller to update itself.</li>
               </ul>
               <h4>The View</h4>
               <ul>
                <li>It means presentation of data in a particular format, triggered by a
                    controller's decision to present the data. They are script-based
                    templating systems like JSP, ASP, PHP and very easy to integrate with
                    AJAX technology.</li>
               </ul>
               <h4>The Controller</h4>
               <ul>
                <li>The controller is responsible for responding to the user input and
                    perform interactions on the data model objects.</li>
                    <li>The controller receives the input, it validates the input and then
                        performs the business operation that modifies the state of the data
                        model.</li>
               </ul>
               <center><h2>React JS</h2></center>
               <ul>
                <li>React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for
                    building user interfaces based on UI components.</li>
                    <li><b>React</b> components implement a render() method that takes input
                        data and returns what to display.</li>
                        <li>The React.js framework is <b>an open-source JavaScript framework and
                            library developed by Facebook.</b>></li>
                           <li>ReactJS is <b>a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for
                            building reusable UI components.</b></li>

               <h3>React Components</h3>
               <ul>
                <li>A <b>Component</b> is one of the core building blocks of <b>React.</b></li>
                <li><b>React components</b> are independent and reusable code. They are the
                    building blocks of any <b>React</b> application.</li>
                    <li><b>DOM</b></li>
                    <li>Interact with a HTML document.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is <b>an application programming
                interface (API) for HTML and XML documents.</b> It defines the logical
                structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and
                manipulated.</p>
                <h3>Virtual Dom</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A virtual DOM is <b>a lightweight JavaScript representation of the
                        Document Object Model (DOM) used in declarative web
                        frameworks such as React, Vue. js, and Elm.</b></li>
                        <li>Updating the virtual DOM is comparatively faster than updating the
                            actual DOM (via JavaScript).</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The name <b>npm</b>(Node Package Manager) stems from when npm first
                        was created as a package manager for Node.js.</li>
                        <li>All <b>npm</b> packages are defined in files called <b>package.json.</b></li>
                        <li>The content of package.json must be written in <b>JSON.</b></li>
                        <li>At least two fields must be present in the definition
                            file: <b>name</b> and <b>version.</b></li>
                            <li><b>npm</b> is the world's largest <b>Software Registry.</b></li>

                <h3>npx</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The npx stands for <b>Node Package Execute</b> and it comes with the
                        npm, when you installed npm above 5.2.0 version then automatically
                        npx will installed.</li>
                        <li>It is an npm package runner that can execute any package that you
                            want from the npm registry without even installing that package.</li>
                            <li>The command <b>npm </b>is used to download JavaScript packages
                                from Node Package Manager, and <b>npx</b> is used to execute JavaScript packages downloaded this way.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Components are <b>independent and reusable bits of code</b>. 
                    </li>
                    <li>They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Components come in two types, <b>Class components and Function components, </b>
                        in this tutorial we will concentrate on Function components.

                <h3>Class Features</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Polymorphism is a feature of object-oriented programming languages that allows
                        <b> a specific routine to use variables of different types at different times.</b> 
                    </li>
                    <li>Inheritance is <b>a way to achieve code reusability when some objects have the same 
                        number of properties that can be shared across the app.</b> Inheritance allows the app to 
                        do the coupling between the parent-child component and reuse properties such as state values 
                        and function in its child components.
                    </li>
                    <li>Function overloading is <b>a mechanism or ability to create multiple 
                        methods with the same name but different parameter types and return type.</b>

                <ol>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Uses native, rather than web components to facilitate native React JS <u>development for Android and iOS.</u>
                        </li>
                        <li>Basically, this feature transforms React code to render it compatible with 
                            iOS or Android platforms and provides access to their native features. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                  
                        <li><b>One-Way Data Binding
                        </b></li>
                 
                    <ul>
                        <li>This means that React uses a flow of data that is unidirectional, forcing 
                            developers to use the callback feature to edit components, and preventing them from editing them directly.
                        </li>
                        <li>The controlling of data flow from a single point is achieved with a JS app 
                            architecture component called Flux. It actually affords developers better control 
                            over the app and makes it more flexible and effective.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>This feature makes React code more readable and easier to fix bugs.
                             React JS is the best platform to develop UIs that are both exciting and 
                             engaging not just for web apps, but mobile apps as well.

                        </b></li>
                   
                    <ul><li>This simply means that the user interface of an app based on React JS
                         is made up of several components, with each of them having its particular logic, written in JS.
                    </li>
                    <li>Due to this, developers can relay the data across the app without the
                         DOM being impacted. React JS components play a huge part in deciding the app visuals and interactions.
